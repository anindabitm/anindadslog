<p>This post is not meant to create panic but to make people aware of the grave COVID-19 situation. I recently came across a number of posts in news and social media showing people who were trying to disobey the lock downs imposed in their respective countries. It’s a really difficult time amidst the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and it can be quite overwhelming to practice Social Distancing adhering to the curfew imposed by the government. The total number of cases have shot up to 499,935 (source : <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</a>) and the reported deaths stand at 22,323. Since there is no vaccine available at the moment, so we need to focus on Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions like ‘Social Distancing’ and Nationwide Lockdown as a suppression strategy. The Transmission or the Reproduction rate, Ro which is the number of persons affected by a COVID-19 infected individual is around 2.4. This means 1 infected individual can affect 2.4 people and the chain goes on like an exponential curve. The message here is to ‘Break the Chain and Flatten the Curve’. This can be done by Social Distancing (which is in our control) and Contact Tracing (which is up to the government as it involves finding infected individuals and quarantining/isolating them from the general population). Nationwide lock-down measures are aimed at bringing down Ro &lt; 1. Data Analysts and Engineers can model COVID-19 cases in their country using this Epidemic calculator, maybe you’’ll be hit by a reality check and feel humbled (<a href="http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html">http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html</a>).</p>

<p>Please don’t act like you’re invincible like Superman and won’t get affected. Once COVID-19 starts spreading in your country, state, district, village etc. it will hit you and hit you very hard. Epidemiologists, medical experts, scientists across the world are struggling to bring the situation under control.</p>

<p>Go have a look at the present condition in Italy (<a href="https://medium.com/@andreasbackhausab/coronavirus-why-its-so-deadly-in-italy-c4200a15a7bf">https://medium.com/@andreasbackhausab/coronavirus-why-its-so-deadly-in-italy-c4200a15a7bf</a>) and maybe you’ll awaken from your egoist slumber. It is in our hands to prevent this global epidemic from affecting us and our loved ones. Stay at home, work at home, dont panic, practice Social Distancing and things will get better soon!</p>
